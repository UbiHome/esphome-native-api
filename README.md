# Rust Crate for the esphome Native API

Implementation of the [esphome native API](https://esphome.io/components/api.html) for Rust.

> This is still work in progress, so the API surface may change. But it is already quite usable. Just try the examples.

While reverse engineering the "missing" documentation of the API was reconstructed: [https://ubihome.github.io/esphome-native-api/native_api/](https://ubihome.github.io/esphome-native-api/native_api/)
